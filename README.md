# Overview 

## What does it do?

Clipbit is a personal data management dApp that uses the user web3 walllet to access and store its passwords, notes and finance tracking.

## Who is it for?

Users that want to simplify the amount of apps needed to manage the data used in their daily life. In addition, clipbit is for those that want more security and privacy of their data.

## Why did you built it?

The idea of building a data management app was interesting since this kind of application has several different features to implement and design. Also, it's useful, challenging and fun to work on. 

## Challenges faced

The main challenge faced was decide how to design the pages to better UI/UX, so we decided to stick to a single color theme for now (light) and explain the user in the home page how clipbit works as a dApp to ensure that users don't familiar with web3 can start using clipbit.

## Future plans

For now, clipbit it's just the frontend app of the idea behind it, so the future plans is add all this logic functionality such as wallet connecting, storage and CRUD functions to manipulate the data.

# Technologies and Setup
