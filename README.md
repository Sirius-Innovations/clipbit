## Challenges faced

The main challenge faced was decide how to design the pages to better UI/UX, so we decided to stick to a single color theme for now (light) and explain the user in the home page how clipbit works as a dApp to ensure that users don't familiar with web3 can start using clipbit.

## Future plans

For now, clipbit it's just the frontend app of the idea behind it, so the future plans is add all this logic functionality such as wallet connecting, storage and CRUD functions to manipulate the data.
